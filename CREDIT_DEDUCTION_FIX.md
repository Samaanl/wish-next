# Credit Deduction Fix - Appwrite Function

## Problem Fixed

The 401 authorization error was caused by the Appwrite Function trying to use the SDK instead of direct API calls. The SDK approach had permission issues, while the fetch API approach works reliably.

## Solution Applied

Updated `appwrite-function-wish-generator.js` to use the same pattern as the working `process-credits` function:

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Removed SDK Dependencies**:

   - Removed `Client`, `Users`, `Databases` imports
   - Removed SDK initialization code

2. **Added Direct API Helper**:

   - Added `appwriteApi()` helper function using fetch
   - Same pattern as the working `process-credits` function
   - Proper error handling and logging

3. **Fixed API Call Format**:

   - Used `{ data: { credits: newCreditBalance } }` wrapper for PATCH operations
   - This matches Appwrite's API requirements

4. **Maintained Security**:
   - Server-side credit checking before wish generation
   - Server-side credit deduction after successful generation
   - Guest user handling (frontend manages guest credits)

## How It Works Now:

### For Authenticated Users:

1. **Pre-Generation**: Check if user has enough credits
2. **Generation**: Call Gemini API to generate wish
3. **Post-Generation**: Deduct credits from user account
4. **Response**: Return wish with updated credit balance

### For Guest Users:

- Skip server-side credit management
- Frontend handles guest user credits locally

## Environment Variables Required:

- `APPWRITE_FUNCTION_PROJECT_ID`
- `APPWRITE_API_KEY`
- `DATABASE_ID`
- `USERS_COLLECTION_ID`

## Testing:

The function should now work without 401 errors because it uses the same proven API approach as your working `process-credits` function.

## Next Steps:

1. Deploy the updated function to Appwrite
2. Test wish generation with a signed-in user
3. Verify credits are properly deducted
4. Check that insufficient credit scenarios work correctly
