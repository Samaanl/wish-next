# Authentication System - Google Only

## 🔧 Simplified Authentication

### **Google Sign-In Only**

The authentication system has been simplified to use **Google OAuth only**. This provides:

- ✅ **Simplified User Experience**: One-click sign-in with Google
- ✅ **No Password Management**: Users don't need to create/remember passwords
- ✅ **Enhanced Security**: OAuth is more secure than email/password
- ✅ **Reduced Complexity**: No email validation, password strength requirements, etc.
- ✅ **Fewer Errors**: Eliminates common email authentication issues

### **What Was Removed**

- ❌ Email/password sign-up form
- ❌ Email/password sign-in form
- ❌ Password validation logic
- ❌ Email format validation
- ❌ Account creation with email/password
- ❌ Anonymous account conversion to email/password
- ❌ Related error handling for email authentication

## 🚀 Current Features
