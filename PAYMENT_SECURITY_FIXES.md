# Payment Security Fixes and Recovery System

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security fixes implemented to address the critical payment vulnerability where users who completed payments on Lemon Squeezy but navigated away before reaching the thank-you page would not receive their purchased credits.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Payment Completion Dependency

**Problem**: The system relied entirely on users reaching the thank-you page to process credits.
**Solution**: Implemented multiple fallback mechanisms:

- Enhanced webhook handling with better error recovery
- New payment verification endpoint that can verify payment status directly with Lemon Squeezy
- Automatic pending payment recovery on user's next visit

### 2. Webhook Security

**Problem**: Development mode bypassed webhook signature verification.
**Solution**:

- Restricted bypass to development environment only
- Enhanced production security with mandatory webhook secret verification
- Added comprehensive error handling in webhook processing

### 3. Transaction Idempotency

**Problem**: Insufficient protection against duplicate payment processing.
**Solution**:

- Added transaction ID tracking using Lemon Squeezy order IDs
- Enhanced duplicate detection in credit processing
- Improved database schema to track transaction sources

## New Components and Endpoints

### 1. Payment Verification Endpoint (`/api/verify-payment`)

**Purpose**: Verifies payment status directly with Lemon Squeezy and processes missed credits.

**Features**:

- Checks for existing purchase records to prevent duplicates
- Calls Lemon Squeezy API to verify order status
- Provides fallback credit processing for unverified but likely valid payments
- Records all transactions with proper metadata

### 2. Enhanced Webhook Handler (`/api/webhooks/lemon-squeezy`)

**Improvements**:

- Production-safe signature verification
- Transaction ID tracking using Lemon Squeezy order IDs
- Better error handling that doesn't break webhook delivery
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### 3. Pending Payment Check Component

**Purpose**: Automatically recovers payments when users return to the site.

**Features**:

- Runs automatically when authenticated users visit the site
- Checks localStorage for unprocessed checkout information
- Verifies payments within 24-hour window
- Shows user-friendly notifications for recovered payments

### 4. Enhanced Credit Service

**Improvements**:

- Added transaction ID parameter to `recordPurchase()`
- Enhanced duplicate detection using database queries
- Better error handling and logging
- Improved idempotency protection

## Payment Flow Security

### Primary Flow (Webhooks)

1. User completes payment on Lemon Squeezy
2. Lemon Squeezy sends webhook to `/api/webhooks/lemon-squeezy`
3. Webhook verifies signature and processes payment
4. Credits are added immediately (best case scenario)

### Secondary Flow (Thank You Page)

1. User returns to thank-you page after payment
2. Page calls `/api/verify-payment` to check payment status
3. If webhook didn't process, verification endpoint handles it
4. Credits are processed with proper transaction tracking

### Tertiary Flow (Automatic Recovery)

1. User visits site later (within 24 hours)
2. `PendingPaymentCheck` component automatically runs
3. Checks for unprocessed payments in localStorage
4. Calls verification endpoint to recover missed payments
5. Notifies user of successful recovery

## Security Measures

### 1. Environment-Based Security

- Development: Webhook signature verification bypassed for testing
- Production: Mandatory webhook secret verification
- Clear logging differentiating between environments

### 2. Transaction Tracking

- All payments tracked with unique transaction IDs
- Lemon Squeezy order IDs used as primary transaction identifiers
- Database records include processing method for audit trail

### 3. Duplicate Prevention

- Database-level duplicate checking before credit processing
- Session-based processing flags to prevent multiple attempts
- Time-based windows for payment recovery (24 hours max)

### 4. Error Handling

- Webhook failures don't break Lemon Squeezy delivery
- Multiple fallback mechanisms for credit processing
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging

## Testing and Validation

### Manual Testing Scenarios

1. **Normal Flow**: Complete payment and reach thank-you page
2. **Back Button**: Complete payment but press browser back button
3. **Tab Close**: Complete payment but close browser tab
4. **Delayed Return**: Complete payment, leave site, return later
5. **Webhook Failure**: Simulate webhook delivery failure

This comprehensive fix ensures that users will receive their purchased credits regardless of their navigation behavior after completing payment, while maintaining security and preventing duplicate charges.
